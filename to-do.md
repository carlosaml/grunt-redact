# grunt-redact's to-do list

- Barf if ```workingDirectory``` is not specified
- Automatically push to npm upon release
- Support "on" and "off" in addition to booleans for the state of toggles
- Create a grunt-redact-sample application to show how everything plays together
- Support a destination directory, that would mean files could not be redacted in place
- Think about negative testsâ€”e.g. how to test featured off things without having to flip the toggle state and re-run the tests
